# float16-fpga-mapping
This describes FPGA mapping of simple components involved in float 16 arithmetic.

This code can be used to reproduce results mentioned in float16 design document at this [link] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1684Tn4aeWxeelCvrJ5maKJoShtlIRolC2oq0c4_4A7k/edit#)

This code can be run using Xilinx XST synthesis tool as a part of Xilinx ISE. The results can be veiwed by generating the synthesis reports and looking for timing and constraiants and other sections in it.
